My background includes embedded systems, software development and system-level solutions gained through diverse projects in large organizations. I thrive in leadership roles where I support teams by removing obstacles, improving ways of working and enabling people to perform at their best. <br /><br />Alongside leadership, I bring a strong technical foundation that helps bridge strategy, architecture and day-to-day execution.
